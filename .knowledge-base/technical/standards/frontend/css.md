## CSS best practices

- **Consistent Methodology**: Apply and stick to the project's consistent CSS methodology (Tailwind, BEM, utility classes, CSS modules, etc.) across the entire project
- **Avoid Overriding Framework Styles**: Work with your framework's patterns rather than fighting against them with excessive overrides
- **Maintain Design System**: Establish and document design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) for consistency
- **Minimize Custom CSS**: Leverage framework utilities and components to reduce custom CSS maintenance burden
- **Performance Considerations**: Optimize for production with CSS purging/tree-shaking to remove unused styles
