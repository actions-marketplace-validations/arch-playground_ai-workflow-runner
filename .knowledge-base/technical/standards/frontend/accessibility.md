## UI accessibility best practices

- **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML elements (nav, main, button, etc.) that convey meaning to assistive technologies
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard with visible focus indicators
- **Color Contrast**: Maintain sufficient contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text) and don't rely solely on color to convey information
- **Alternative Text**: Provide descriptive alt text for images and meaningful labels for all form inputs
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Test and verify that all views are accessible on screen reading devices.
- **ARIA When Needed**: Use ARIA attributes to enhance complex components when semantic HTML isn't sufficient
- **Logical Heading Structure**: Use heading levels (h1-h6) in proper order to create a clear document outline
- **Focus Management**: Manage focus appropriately in dynamic content, modals, and single-page applications
